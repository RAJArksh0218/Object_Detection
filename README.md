# Object_Detection
A Real-time Object Detection system implemented using YOLOv3, Python, and OpenCV. Capable of detecting multiple objects in images and video feeds.
YOLO (You Only Look Once) is an algorithm used for object detection, which means it helps a computer identify and locate objects in an image or video. It's commonly used in AI projects like self-driving cars, security cameras, and robotics to detect objects like pedestrians, cars, or animals.

How YOLO Works:

Input Image: You give YOLO an image.

Divides Image into a Grid: YOLO divides the image into a grid (for example, 7x7 cells).

Prediction in Each Grid: Each grid cell predicts two things:

What object is in the cell (if any), such as a car, dog, or person. Bounding box: The position and size of the object within the image.

Single Pass: Unlike older methods that look at different parts of the image multiple times, YOLO looks at the image only once, hence the name.

Key Points:

Fast: YOLO is very fast compared to older object detection algorithms because it processes the image in one go.

Real-time: It’s quick enough to detect objects in real-time, which is crucial for tasks like autonomous driving.

Accuracy: YOLO is accurate, but it might sometimes struggle with detecting smaller objects because it processes the whole image at once.

Use in AI Projects: In an AI project, you can use YOLO to train a model on a dataset of images with labeled objects. Once trained, the model can: Detect objects in real-time from a camera feed. Recognize multiple objects in the same image. Help the AI make decisions based on what it sees, like stopping a self-driving car when it detects a pedestrian.

In short, YOLO is popular for AI-based object detection tasks because it's both fast and reasonably accurate, making it useful for many real-world applications.
